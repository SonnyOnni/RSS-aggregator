# Description: 
**RSS aggregator** (or **RSS reader**) - the software could use the XML structure to present a neat display to the end users.

Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitor sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them. 

Users subscribe to feeds by entering a feed's URI into the reader. The reader checks the user's feeds regularly for new information and can automatically download it.
